This is a comprehensive and ambitious project! Here’s how I’ll approach building your full-stack e-commerce baby clothing store, step by step, following your priorities and tech stack.

---

## 1. **Project Structure & Initialization**

**Directory Layout:**
- `client/` (React 18 + Vite + Tailwind + Shadcn/ui)
- `server/` (Express + Drizzle + PostgreSQL)
- `shared/` (Zod schemas)
- Root config files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, etc.)

**First Steps:**
- Initialize a monorepo (Yarn workspaces or npm workspaces recommended for shared code).
- Set up `client`, `server`, and `shared` packages.
- Add all required dependencies for each part of the stack.
- Configure TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind, Drizzle, and Express.

---

## 2. **Database Schema (Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL)**

- Create all tables as described (users, categories, products, carts, cart_items, orders, order_items, wishlists, reviews, sessions).
- Use Drizzle ORM migrations and types.
- Set up connection pooling and session storage.

---

## 3. **Backend API (Express + Drizzle + Zod)**

- Implement authentication routes (register, login, logout, get user).
- Implement product, cart, order, wishlist, and review routes.
- Use Zod for request validation (imported from `shared/`).
- Secure endpoints with session-based auth and role checks.
- Add error handling middleware and CORS.

---

## 4. **Frontend (React + Vite + Wouter + Tailwind + Shadcn/ui)**

- Set up routing for all pages.
- Build shared UI components (Navbar, Footer, Sidebar, Buttons, etc.).
- Implement pages: Landing, Home, Shop, Product Detail, Cart, Checkout, Profile, Admin, Login/Signup.
- Use React Query for data fetching and caching.
- Use React Hook Form + Zod for forms.
- Add Framer Motion for animations and Lucide for icons.
- Style with Tailwind and custom pastel color palette.

---

## 5. **Core Features**

- **Authentication:** Registration, login, logout, session management, role-based access.
- **Product Catalog:** Filtering, searching, product details, reviews.
- **Cart & Checkout:** Persistent cart, real-time stock, multi-step checkout, order creation.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Product/category CRUD, inventory, bulk management.
- **Order Management:** Order history, status updates, admin processing.
- **Wishlist & Reviews:** Add/remove wishlist items, leave/read reviews.

---

## 6. **Validation, Security, and Optimization**

- Shared Zod schemas for validation.
- Bcrypt for password hashing.
- Secure session cookies, CORS, and input sanitization.
- React Query caching, code splitting, image optimization.

---

## 7. **Sample Data & Testing**

- Seed categories and products.
- Add sample users (admin/customer).
- Test all flows (auth, shopping, checkout, admin).

---

## 8. **Responsive UI/UX**

- Mobile-first layouts.
- Skeleton loaders, toasts, error boundaries.
- Modern, readable fonts and baby-themed color palette.

---

## 9. **Scripts & Environment**

- Add all scripts to `package.json`.
- Document environment variables.

---

## 10. **Next Steps**

**I will:**
1. Scaffold the project structure and initialize configs.
2. Set up the database schema and Drizzle ORM.
3. Implement the authentication system (backend + frontend).
4. Build the product catalog and display.
5. Continue with cart, checkout, admin, and advanced features.

---

**Let’s begin by scaffolding the project structure and initializing the monorepo with the required directories and config files.**  
Once the structure is in place, I’ll move on to the database schema and backend setup.

Would you like to use Yarn workspaces, npm workspaces, or keep it as a flat structure?  
If you have a preference, let me know—otherwise, I’ll proceed with npm workspaces for simplicity and compatibility.
